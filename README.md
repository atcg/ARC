2014-03-12:
* Some major improvements were made over the last few months, these include:
    * A total refactor of the job handling mechanism which improved efficiency and speed, and simplified the code significantly.
    * A bug was identified in the code which would allow bowtie2 to map a read to more than one target even when bowtie_2k=1 was set (in certain circumstances). This should be resolved now, but more testing wouldn't hurt.
    * Fixed a race condition which sometimes caused ARC to crash on slow file systems.
    * Version number is ALWAYS printed out to help with debugging.
    * The latest version should by v1.1.1. Upgrading to this version is recommended.

* Prepping for a v1.1.0 release.
