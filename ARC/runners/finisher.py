    Iterate through all targets, pull out the assembled contigs, rename
    them to:

        Sample_:_Target_:_ContigN
        Output to: finished_SAMPLE/contigs.fasta

    Finisher knows that an assembly is finished because it finds a
    "finished" file inside of the assemblies temporary folder.  The
    finished file will contain a status which can be one of the following:
        assembly_complete : a normal assembly which completed without error
        assembly_failed   : The assembly failed.
                            Don't copy contigs.
                            Copy reads as contigs with name:
                                Sample_:_Target_:_ReadN
                            (note that if no new reads are mapped, this
                                should auto-terminate, so there should be
                                no need for a minreads type of control,
                                however this may generate spurious assemblies
                                which will need to be accounted for in the
                                cleanup module.)
        map_against_reads : No assembly was attempted.
                            Copy reads as contigs with name:
                                Sample_:_Target_:_ReadN
                            (the logic for when to do this will be handled
                            by the Assembler)

    Output to finished contigs depends on:
    1) If params['iteration'] >= params['numcycles'] all output goes to
        the final contigs file. In the case where no contigs were assembled
        (finished:assembly_failed or finished:map_against_reads) reads go to
        contigs file.
        Reads have the naming convention: Sample_:_Target_:_ReadN
    2) if params['readcounts'][iteration] <= params['readcount'][iteration - 1]
        meaning no more reads were incorporated reads + contigs go to final
        output, remove from further mapping/assembly. In the case where no
        contigs were assembled (finished:assembly_failed or
        finished:map_against_reads) reads go to contigs file.
        Reads have the naming convention: Sample_:_Target_:_ReadN

    3) if reads were mapped but no contigs were generated, write the reads
        out as new targets for the next mapping cycle
    4) if params['readcounts'][iteration] / params['readcount'][iteration - 1] > max_incorportaion:
        This is probably repetitive sequence,
    5) if 'map_against_reads' in params and params['iteration'] == 1:
        On the first iteration, write all reads out as contigs
        (there is no expectation of an assembly having been done in this case)
